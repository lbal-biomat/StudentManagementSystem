# Student management system

This is my first personal project. It is an interactive console application written in C++. 

It consists on a basic student management system that keeps track of the students, its grades, its class enrollments, and all the data generated in their activities.
It also keeps track of the courses offered, the available classrooms, and the reservations for said classrooms.

This is a work in progess.
